Bonus Ideas:
Change favicon from default react app.
Add some logic/functionality that will make income a positive number and an expenditure a negative number, rather than having the user type it in.
Use react-bootstrap or a similar CSS framework to help style your app.
Show the amount in the nav bar, so it is visible on every view.
Use the date object for the date, instead of just a string.
Use the input type date for the date.
Add a library like chartjs or D3 to provide visualizations the budget app.
Be sure to confirm with your instructor which bonus idea you will implement.
